# Student-Information-System
A Student Information System, or SIS, is a web-based platform that helps schools and colleges take data online for easier management and better clarity. That's at its most basic.   
The SIS system is able to collect school-wide data online so that it can be easily accessed by teachers, parents, students, and administrators. 
That includes records of tests, attendance, appraisal performance, and plenty more.
